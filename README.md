# **Todo Application**

A simple, standalone Angular application for managing tasks. This application is built with Angular's modern standalone components and NgRx for state management. It includes features like task creation, updates, and deletion, with persistent state management and multi-language support using ngx-translate.

---

## **Features**

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Angular Material components.
- **State Management**: Uses NgRx for predictable and centralized state management.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Integrated with `ngx-translate` for internationalization.
- **Modern Angular**: Built using Angular standalone components, following best practices.
- **Persistent State**: Stores application state in localStorage to preserve tasks across sessions.

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (v16 or higher)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/y0h3r/todo-list-app-angular.git
   cd todo-list-app-angular
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

---

## **Usage**

### **Home Page**
The home page displays a list of all tasks. You can:
- **Add a Task**: Enter a task description and click "Add Task".
- **Edit a Task**: Click the edit icon next to a task to modify it.
- **Delete a Task**: Click the delete icon next to a task to remove it.

### **State Persistence**
The application uses NgRx with localStorage to persist tasks between sessions.

### **Multi-Language Support**
Switch languages dynamically using the language dropdown (English and Spanish are available by default).

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Static assets such as images, styles, or translation files
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n/           # JSON translation files for multi-language support
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ environments/       # Environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, prod)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/           # Feature-specific modules and components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/             # Shared utilities, components, directives, and pipes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.component.*     # Root component files (HTML, SCSS, TS)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.config.ts       # Configuration or constants for the app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.routes.ts       # Application routing configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Entry point for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts                 # Bootstrap file for the Angular app
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.scss             # Global styles for the application
```

## **State Management**

The application uses NgRx to manage state:

- **Actions**: Define user actions like `addTask`, `editTask`, and `deleteTask`.
- **Reducer**: Handles state transitions based on actions.
- **Selectors**: Fetch derived state like the list of completed tasks.

---

## **Internationalization (i18n)**

The app uses **ngx-translate** for multi-language support.

### Adding a New Language

1. Add a new JSON file in `assets/i18n/`, e.g., `fr.json` for French.
2. Update the `TranslateService` to include the new language.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Angular**: Framework for building web applications.
- **NgRx**: State management library for Angular.
- **Angular Material**: UI components for Angular.
- **ngx-translate**: Internationalization library for Angular.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add authentication for user-specific task management.
- Integrate with a backend API for real-time updates.
- Implement categories and task prioritization.
- Add more language options.
